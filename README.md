# 🌶️ SPyCe Compiler

SPyCe, short for Simple Python and C Environment, is a beginner-friendly programming language that combines Python’s readability with C’s explicit structure to teach core programming concepts so learners see both how to write readable code and how types and declarations work. “SPyCe” reflects its goal to make learning programming approachable and enjoyable, like a gentle seasoning.
